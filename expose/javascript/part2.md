Q1. It will print 3, the last iteration of i(lenght=3).

Q2. It will print 150, the last iteration of discountedPrice(300*(1-0.5)).

Q3. It will print 150, the last iteration of finalPrice.

Q4. The function will return a list of finalPrice(s), [50,100,150], because each finalPrice is pushed to the list.

Q5. The code causes an error, since i is limited to the scope of for loop.

Q6. The code causes an error, since discountedPrice is limited to the scope of for loop.

Q7. It will print 150, the last iteration of finalPrice, since finalPrice is defined at function scope.

Q8. The function will return a list of finalPrice(s), [50,100,150], because each finalPrice is pushed to the list.

Q9. The code causes an error, since i is limited to the scope of for loop.

Q10. It will print 3, the constant variable length is set to 3 at the beginning.

Q11. The function will return a list of discountedPrice(s), [50,100,150], because each discountedPrice is pushed to the list.

Q12. 
A student.name \n
B student['Grad Year'] \n
C student.greeting() \n
D student['Favorite Teacher'].name \n
E student.courseLoad[0]

Q13. 
A Output is ‘32’. + will make integer 2 becomes string '2'. \n
B Output is 1. - will make string '3' becomes integer 3. \n
C Output is 3. null becomes an integer.
D Output is '3null'. null becomes a string.
E Output is 4. true becomes integer 1.
F Output is 0. false becomes integer 0, and null is 0.
G Output is '3undefined'. undefined becomes string. 
H Output is NaN. undefined cannot be an integer value.

Q14.
A Output is true. string '2' becomes integer 2.
B Output is false. Alphabetically 1 is less than 2.
C Output is true. string '2' becomes integer 2.
D Output is false. different datatypes.
E Output is false. 1 != 2.
F Output is true. Boolean(2) is true, and it has same value and type with true.

Q15. Both "===" and "==" compare two variables, but "==" only compares the value, "===" compares the datatype as well besides the value.

Q17. The result will be [2,4,6]. doSomething is a callback function, and we give it the actual parameter in the for loop(line 4). What doSomething does is just double the input number.
